- Started the project by using this compilation command
```
go build -race -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go 
```
First understanding what race and buildmode actually mean

[Understanding the race flag](https://go.dev/blog/race-detector)
[Understanding Build modes in Go](youtube.com/watch?v=x-LhC-J2Vbk)

The build modes were interesting, one thing that didn't make sense to me 
was what was the difference between normal .exe binaries and pie binaries. 
Almost all Os now do virtual memory, paging and swapping so pie should not
be an option but a necessity for all executables. Will research about this more in the future

- Looked up how to implement the RPC in go
